 sweden_event_je.9.t: "The Farmer's New Influence"
 sweden_event_je.9.d: "The passage of the Representation Reform of 1866 has irrevocably altered the political landscape, especially in our vast rural areas.

Under the new system, which grants voting rights based on income and property, the self-owning farmers – particularly those with land valued at 1,000 riksdaler or more – have become a dominant force. Their collective voice, rooted in their economic might and land ownership, now carries significant weight. However, this reform has also highlighted, and indeed exacerbated, the growing chasm between these prosperous farmers and the increasing numbers of landless laborers, cottagers, and small craftsmen, who remain largely disenfranchised. The countryside is no longer a monolithic political bloc."
